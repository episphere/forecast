# EpiForecast

A visual analytics tool for performing and analyzing interpretable forecasts using empirical dynamic modelling.

**The web-tool is available [here](https://episphere.github.io/forecast/).** For instructions on how to use it, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU31yz6kiQA&feature=youtu.be). 

For more information, see our paper: [Interpretable, non-mechanistic forecasting using empirical dynamic modeling and interactive visualization](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0277149). Alternatively, we have created an [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@siliconjazz/edm-interpretable-forecasting?collection=@siliconjazz/epiforecast) which interactively explains the basics of how EpiForecast works.



This repository can also be imported as an ES6 module. For instructions and more information about the methods available, see [this notebook](https://observablehq.com/@siliconjazz/epiforecast-library).
